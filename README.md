## Introduction to MySQL
- What is MySQL?
- Key features of MySQL
- MySQL vs. other databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- MySQL Architecture

## Installing and Configuring MySQL
- Installing MySQL on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- MySQL Workbench: Installation and setup
- Basic configuration and initialization
- Starting and stopping MySQL server

## Basic SQL Commands
- Connecting to MySQL server
- Creating a database (`CREATE DATABASE`)
- Selecting a database (`USE`)
- Viewing available databases (`SHOW DATABASES`)
- Dropping a database (`DROP DATABASE`)

## Tables and Data Types
- Creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`)
- Data types in MySQL: INT, VARCHAR, DATE, FLOAT, etc.
- Modifying table structures (`ALTER TABLE`)
- Dropping a table (`DROP TABLE`)
- Understanding constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL

## CRUD Operations (Basic Queries)
- Inserting data into tables (`INSERT INTO`)
- Retrieving data (`SELECT`)
- Updating data (`UPDATE`)
- Deleting data (`DELETE`)
- Filtering results with `WHERE`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
- Limiting result sets with `LIMIT`

## Joins and Relationships
- Understanding relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN (if supported)
- CROSS JOIN
- Using aliases for tables

## Grouping and Aggregation
- Using `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Filtering groups with `HAVING`
- Using `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicate values

## Subqueries
- Using subqueries in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
- Correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries
- EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators
- IN and NOT IN operators

## Indexes
- Understanding indexes: Why and when to use them
- Creating indexes (`CREATE INDEX`)
- Dropping indexes (`DROP INDEX`)
- Types of indexes: UNIQUE, FULLTEXT, and more
- Query optimization using indexes

## Transactions and ACID Properties
- What are transactions?
- BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK statements
- Isolation levels in transactions
- Ensuring ACID properties in MySQL
- Handling deadlocks

## Normalization and Database Design
- Understanding normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Benefits of normalization
- Designing efficient database schemas
- Denormalization and when it might be useful

## Stored Procedures and Functions
- Creating and using stored procedures (`CREATE PROCEDURE`)
- Creating and using functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`)
- Input and output parameters
- Control flow (IF, LOOP, CASE)
- Error handling

## Triggers
- What are triggers?
- Creating triggers (`CREATE TRIGGER`)
- Trigger events: BEFORE, AFTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Using triggers for data validation and auditing

## Views
- Creating views (`CREATE VIEW`)
- Benefits of using views
- Updating views
- Dropping views

## User Management and Security
- Creating users and assigning permissions (`CREATE USER`, `GRANT`)
- Managing user roles and privileges
- Revoking privileges (`REVOKE`)
- Securing MySQL server with passwords and SSL connections
- Understanding MySQL security best practices

## Backups and Recovery
- Methods for backing up MySQL databases (mysqldump, MySQL Workbench, etc.)
- Restoring databases from backup
- Point-in-time recovery
- Automating backup processes

## Performance Tuning
- Query optimization techniques
- Using `EXPLAIN` to analyze query execution plans
- Caching strategies in MySQL
- Managing large databases and high-traffic environments
- Optimizing MySQL configuration parameters

## Replication and High Availability
- Master-slave replication
- Configuring replication in MySQL
- Failover and clustering solutions
- High availability setups: Galera Cluster, MySQL Group Replication

## Advanced Topics
- Full-Text Search in MySQL
- Partitioning tables
- Event scheduling with MySQL Events
- JSON support and document storage in MySQL
- MySQL and NoSQL features (using MySQL as a document store)

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting
- Writing clean, efficient SQL code
- Debugging common SQL errors
- Handling concurrency issues
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Logging and error handling best practices
